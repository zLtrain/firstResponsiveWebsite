    <div>
        <p>I've lived all over the United States working Odd Jobs for Friends & Family while building a modest Resume of Retail, Customer Service, and Sales Jobs intended to reflect a strong work-ethic after entering The Work Force right away after graduating from High School. I never went to college because I learn best in a Mentor/Apprentice Environment Vs. a Classroom Environment so I spent my years in The Work Force deciding what I really wanted to commit myself to Learning/Mastering. Web Development, Web Design, App Development, App Design, Front-End-Code, Back-End-Code, JavaScript, etc. Is what I finally settled on, and I am currently a Full-Time Student at Austin Coding Academy.</p>
